# 100 Days of Code
  The essence of the 100 Days of Code is to learn consistently and learning will i do during this period. I plan to cover the following areas

   * GraphQL
   * Laravel
   * ElectronJS
   * React Native
      advanced functionality
      using react-native-maps
      push notification

   * TypeScript
   * ReasonML
   * Continuous Integration, Testing
   * React Hooks and Context API



   OPTIONAL
   *

   Apart from the above, starting from day 10 to day 40, i might start a daily job application binge - one job application per day.
   The company's culture is important.

   Also, search for what Google Nigeria, Microsoft and other big time players demand from their employees in terms of technology requirement, then integrate that into your learning.
